# Collatz Checker
 Takes a number and applies the 3n+1 rule to it.

I originally made this after watching this video a little ago, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mFpVDpKX70
However I lost it somewhere, so I'm making it again after seeing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg 

The Python version of this project breaks after a certain point because of python limitations but it works up to like e+16 or something but the program will probably make it go higher.

I think other languages deal with large numbers better so I might make programs in different languages, there may be a way to deal with it in python but oh well
